# 05-Space-SHMUP

For my spaceshooter I wanted to implement a scoreboard that shows both a highscore and a score and I was sucessful 
as in creating it as I created 2 scripts 1 for score 1 for highscore and added it into the main script and was able to 
implement to gain a score every time a enemy is destroyed.

Rebalance: I increased the speed of the hero to be able to move around the grpund quicker.
for the blaster increased the damage to 4 and for the Spread I increased the damage to 10 but gave it a huge delay time.
